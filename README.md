Tic Tac Toe Pro - Browser-Based Game
Tic Tac Toe Pro is an interactive browser-based game created as Task 3 of my internship at Skill Craft Technology!  It gives you a great way for two players to play Tic Tac Toe online with a fun interface that is responsive. 

Project Summary
Tic Tac Toe Pro is designed for quick local two-player games. All the game logic is completely front end so you won't have to deal with using a back end service, and you will be provided with smooth, interactive gameplay in the form of visual feedback and tracking game results.

The Functionality
Classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe Board

Two-player local game (Player X vs Player O)

Validation of game status (turns, win/draw status)

Button to reset game to start a new game

Ease of use with a responsive design for desktop and mobile

Technologies Used
HTML5 - Structure and content

CSS3 / Tailwind CSS - Styling and layout of elements

JavaScript - Game logic and handling of interactions
